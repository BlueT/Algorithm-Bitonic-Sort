NAME
    Algorithm::Bitonic::Sort - Sorting numbers with Bitonic Sort

VERSION
    Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
    Use Algorithm::Bitonic::Sort with the following style.

            use Algorithm::Bitonic::Sort;
        
            my @sample = (1,4,8,4,4365,2,67,33,345);
            my @result_inc = bitonic_sort( 1 ,@sample);     # incremental
            my @result_dec = bitonic_sort( 0 ,@sample);     # decremental

DESCRIPTION
    Bitonic mergesort is a parallel algorithm for sorting. It is also used as
    a construction method for building a sorting network. This is an Perl 5
    implementation of Ken Batcher's Bitonic mergesort.

Limitation
    This is a enhanced version of Bitonic Sort which removed the limitation of
    original version. This module supports any amount of numbers.

    The original Bitonic can only sort N numbers, which N is a power of 2.

EXPORT
    bitonic_sort

SUBROUTINES
  bitonic_sort
    The First Parameter works as the ascending/decreasing selector. True (1 or
    any true value) means ascending (incremental), False (0 or any false
    value) means decreasing.

    All other params will be treated as members/items to be sorted.
